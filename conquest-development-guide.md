# Key Implementation Challenges

1. Game State Synchronization:
   - Ensure all players see the same game state
   - Handle network latency and disconnections gracefully

2. Scalability:
   - Design the server architecture to handle multiple concurrent games
   - Implement efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms

3. AI Implementation:
   - Develop an AI opponent for single-player mode
   - Balance AI difficulty levels

4. User Experience:
   - Create smooth animations for unit movements and combat
   - Implement an intuitive UI for complex game actions

5. Performance:
   - Optimize rendering for large game boards
   - Minimize network traffic by sending only necessary updates
