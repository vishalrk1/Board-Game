## Character Selection and Movement

1. How many characters will each player be allowed to choose?
   - 6 players will be assigned to each players ( randomly placed )
   - At the start of the game, each player can choose a total of 10 units ( future plan).
   - The initial selection must include at least one of each unit type ( future plan).
   - As the game progresses, players can recruit more units based on their resources and controlled territories ( future plan).
   - There's a soft cap of 20 units per player to maintain game balance ( future plan).

2.Board Layout
   - The game is played on an 8x8 square grid. We'll divide the board into different terrain types:
      - Plains (50% of squares): Normal movement for all units.
      - Forests (25% of squares): Reduces movement by 1 (minimum 1). Provides cover, reducing damage taken by 25%.
      - Water (25% of squares): Only Archers and Mages can enter. Other units must go around.

## Resource Usage in Gameplay
**THIS IS FOR FUTURE REFERANCES**
3. How different resources will be used while playing the game:

   Gold:
   - Primary resource for recruiting new units
   - Used to upgrade existing units
   - Spent on researching new technologies
   - Can be traded for other resources at a market (if implemented)

   Food:
   - Required to maintain units (each unit consumes 1 food per turn)
   - Used to heal units (spend food to restore health)
   - Excess food increases population growth in controlled territories
   - Can be converted to gold at a reduced rate

   Materials:
   - Used for constructing buildings and fortifications
   - Required for crafting special equipment for units
   - Spent on developing advanced technologies
   - Used to repair damaged structures

   Resource Generation:
   - Territories generate resources each turn based on their type:
     - Plains: Balanced resource generation
     - Forests: High food and materials, low gold
     - Mountains: High materials and gold, low food
     - Coastal areas: High gold, moderate food, low materials
   - Players can construct buildings to enhance resource production:
     - Farms: Increase food production
     - Mines: Boost material output
     - Markets: Generate additional gold

   Resource Management:
   - Players must balance resource usage between unit recruitment, maintenance, and development.
   - Efficient resource management is key to sustaining a large army and expanding territory.
   - Trading excess resources or raiding enemy territories can be viable strategies for resource acquisition.
