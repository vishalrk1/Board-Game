## Character Selection and Movement

1. How many characters will each player be allowed to choose?
   - At the start of the game, each player can choose a total of 10 units.
   - The initial selection must include at least one of each unit type.
   - As the game progresses, players can recruit more units based on their resources and controlled territories.
   - There's a soft cap of 20 units per player to maintain game balance.

2. How each character will move in the game:
   - Movement is based on the number of hexes a unit can traverse per turn.
   - Terrain affects movement:
     - Plains: Normal movement
     - Forests: Reduces movement by 1 (minimum 1)
     - Mountains: Reduces movement by 2 (minimum 1)
     - Water: Only naval units can enter
   - Units cannot move through enemy units unless using a special ability.
   - Some special abilities may allow for additional movement or unique movement patterns.

## Resource Usage in Gameplay

3. How different resources will be used while playing the game:

   Gold:
   - Primary resource for recruiting new units
   - Used to upgrade existing units
   - Spent on researching new technologies
   - Can be traded for other resources at a market (if implemented)

   Food:
   - Required to maintain units (each unit consumes 1 food per turn)
   - Used to heal units (spend food to restore health)
   - Excess food increases population growth in controlled territories
   - Can be converted to gold at a reduced rate

   Materials:
   - Used for constructing buildings and fortifications
   - Required for crafting special equipment for units
   - Spent on developing advanced technologies
   - Used to repair damaged structures

   Resource Generation:
   - Territories generate resources each turn based on their type:
     - Plains: Balanced resource generation
     - Forests: High food and materials, low gold
     - Mountains: High materials and gold, low food
     - Coastal areas: High gold, moderate food, low materials
   - Players can construct buildings to enhance resource production:
     - Farms: Increase food production
     - Mines: Boost material output
     - Markets: Generate additional gold

   Resource Management:
   - Players must balance resource usage between unit recruitment, maintenance, and development.
   - Efficient resource management is key to sustaining a large army and expanding territory.
   - Trading excess resources or raiding enemy territories can be viable strategies for resource acquisition.

This design provides a diverse set of characters with unique strengths and weaknesses, a flexible character selection system, and a deep resource management aspect that adds strategic depth to the gameplay.
